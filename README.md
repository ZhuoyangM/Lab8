## Questions
1. I choose 1, since the point of automation testing is to be able to run tests automatically whenever codes are pushed to repo or other situations like that.
2. No, unit test would fit better.
3. No, because sending message is a complex action which requires individual components to interact with each other and unit test is not a good choice.
4. Yes, because max message length is a stand-alone feature, so using unit test is appropriate.
